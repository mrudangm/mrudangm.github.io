abstract = {Nearly 1.6 million Americans suffer from a leaking tricuspid heart valve. To make matters worse, current valve repair options are far from optimal leading to recurrence of leakage in up to 30% of patients. We submit that a critical step toward improving outcomes is to better understand the “forgotten” valve. High-fidelity computer models may help in this endeavour. However, the existing models are limited by averaged or idealized geometries, material properties, and boundary conditions. In our current work, we overcome the limitations of existing models by (reverse) engineering the tricuspid valve from a beating human heart in an organ preservation system. The resulting finite-element model faithfully captures the kinematics and kinetics of the native tricuspid valve as validated against echocardiographic data and others' previous work. To showcase the value of our model, we also use it to simulate disease-induced and repair-induced changes to valve geometry and mechanics. Specifically, we simulate and compare the effectiveness of tricuspid valve repair via surgical annuloplasty and via transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. Importantly, our model is openly available for others to use. Thus, our model will allow us and others to perform virtual experiments on the healthy, diseased, and repaired tricuspid valve to better understand the valve itself and to optimize tricuspid valve repair for better patient outcomes.},

@article{Meador2020a,
abstract = {Over 1.6 million Americans suffer from significant tricuspid valve leakage. In most cases this leakage is designated as secondary. Thus, valve dysfunction is assumed to be due to valve-extrinsic factors. We challenge this paradigm and hypothesize that the tricuspid valve maladapts in those patients rendering the valve at least partially culpable for its dysfunction. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we set out to demonstrate that the tricuspid valve maladapts in disease. To this end, we induced biventricular heart failure in sheep that developed tricuspid valve leakage. In the anterior leaflets of those animals, we investigated maladaptation on multiple scales. We demonstrated alterations on the protein and cell-level, leading to tissue growth, thickening, and stiffening. These data provide a new perspective on a poorly understood, yet highly prevalent disease. Our findings may motivate novel therapy options for many currently untreated patients with leaky tricuspid valves.},

@article{Meador2020b,
abstract = {The tricuspid valve ensures unidirectional blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. The three tricuspid leaflets operate within a dynamic stress environment of shear, bending, tensile, and compressive forces, which is cyclically repeated nearly three billion times in a lifetime. Ostensibly, the microstructural and mechanical properties of the tricuspid leaflets have mechanobiologically evolved to optimally support their function under those forces. Yet, how the tricuspid leaflet microstructure determines its mechanical properties and whether this relationship differs between the three leaflets is unknown. Here we perform a microstructural and mechanical analysis in matched ovine tricuspid leaflet samples. We found that the microstructure and mechanical properties vary among the three tricuspid leaflets in sheep. Specifically, we found that tricuspid leaflet composition, collagen orientation, and valve cell nuclear morphology are spatially heterogeneous and vary across leaflet type. Furthermore, under biaxial tension, the leaflets' mechanical behaviors exhibited unequal degrees of mechanical anisotropy. Most importantly, we found that the septal leaflet was stiffer in the radial direction and not the circumferential direction as with the other two leaflets. The differences we observed in leaflet microstructure coincide with the varying biaxial mechanics among leaflets. Our results demonstrate the structure-function relationship for each leaflet in the tricuspid valve. We anticipate our results to be vital toward developing more accurate, leaflet-specific tricuspid valve computational models. Furthermore, our results may be clinically important, informing differential surgical treatments of the tricuspid valve leaflets. Finally, the identified structure-function relationships may provide insight into the homeostatic and remodeling potential of valvular cells in altered mechanical environments, such as in diseased or repaired tricuspid valves. Statement of significance: Our work is significant as we investigated the structure-function relationship of ovine tricuspid valve leaflets. This is important as tricuspid valves fail frequently and our current approach to repairing them is suboptimal. Specifically, we related the distribution of structural and cellular elements, such as collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and cell nuclei, to each leaflet's mechanical properties. We found that leaflets have different structures and that their mechanics differ. This may, in the future, inform leaflet-specific treatment strategies and help optimize surgical outcomes.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
