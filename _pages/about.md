# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I work with [Dr. William Hiesinger](https://www.hiesingerlab.com/) in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Stanford Medicine, on physics-based virtual surgical planning and training of surgical robots. Previously, I completed my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, working with [Dr. Manuel K. Rausch](http://www.manuelrausch.com/) on tricuspid valve biomechanics. Before moving to the US, I received a B.Tech degree in Mechanical Engineering from Delhi Technological University.

My research interests include cardiovascular biomechanics, computational science, surgical robotics, image processing, and scientific visualization.
